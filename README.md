## What does Aru do?
Aru is a multi-purpose Discord bot with "action" commands, music commands, info commands, and more.

### Action Commands
The /action command allows a user to specify an action, e.g., "blush", "slap", "wink", and direct it towards another user. Aru will fetch a random anime gif from her database corresponding to the specified action and send it to the channel that the command was used in, along with a message describing what action has been performed, mentioning both the actor and recipient of the action. Here's an example:

#### Adding a GIF to the database
One of Aru's shining features is that she allows users to contribute their own GIFs to the database that she fetches GIFs from! To do so, a user can use the /addgif command, like so:
