# lavasnek_rs

Lavasnek is a lavalink wrapper for any asyncio python discord library. Lavalink is a standalone audio sending node for playing audio on discord voice channels.
It also has utilities like searching on several websites such as YouTube, Twitch and SoundCloud.

## Installing the library

The library is available on PyPi, and you can install it via `pip install lavasnek_rs --pre -U --user`

To install a developement release of the library, go to the Actions tab on GitHub, select the latest commit,
and download the Artifact that suits your needs. Extract the artifact, and install the .whl file with
`pip install -U --user filename.whl`

Then you should be able to import the library and use it!

## Using the library

This library can be used with any asyncio based discord library, from hikari, to hata (with a compatibility layer), to any of the discord.py forks.

You can find basic examples using the library on the examples folder of the repository. Make sure to select the branch tag with the version you are using,
as the master branch could have differences that may not work on the current releases of lavasnek.

## Building the library

If you wanna build the project from source, (for contributing, compiling to a different architecture than
x86_64 or for python 3.10) you will need:

```bash
# It is highly recommended that you use Linux, either natively or with WSL2

# You will need python 3.6 or newer.
sudo apt install python3-pip curl # for Ubuntu, Debian or derivatives
sudo pacman -S python3-pip curl # for Arch, EndeavourOS, Manjaro or derivatives

# You will also need the rust programming language.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# You will also need a lavalink server running.
# see https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink or use docker
docker run --name lavalink -p 2333:2333 -d -v $HOME/application.yml:/opt/Lavalink/application.yml fredboat/lavalink:dev
```

Then to run the project, just run all of this.
Only the last 2 are repeatable.

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin

maturin develop
python examples/pure_hikari_basic_queue/bot.py
```
